# Ad-Scrapper
An Ad scrapper using python ,BeautifulSoup and request
We used requests to get the page from the AllSides server, but now we need the BeautifulSoup library  to parse HTML and XML.Afterwards by using inspect element of any site we can select the google ad's section and select it to see under what category it is.Now we enter a search query and get the html code.Now we find it and iterate through the loop till we need to scrape the data.
